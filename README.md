# KIBO-ROBOT-PROGRAMMING-CHALLANGE

The Kibo Robot Programming Challenge is an educational program in which students solve various problems by programming free-flying robots (Astrobee and Int-Ball) in the International Space Station (ISS).The Kibo-RPC will inspire students to develop their educational and professional goals to a higher level.


Astrobee Robot Software

About

AstrobeeAstrobee is a free-flying robot designed to operate as a payload inside the International Space Station (ISS). The Astrobee Robot Software consists of embedded (on-board) software, supporting tools and a simulator. The Astrobee Robot Software operates on Astrobee's three internal single board computers and uses the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) framework as message-passing middleware. The Astrobee Robot Software performs vision-based localization, provides autonomous navigation, docking and perching, manages various sensors and actuators, and supports user interaction via screen-based displays, light signaling, and sound. The Astrobee Robot Software enables Astrobee to be operated in multiple modes: plan-based task execution (command sequencing), teleoperation, or autonomously through execution of hosted code uploaded by project partners (guest science). The software simulator enables Astrobee Robot Software to be evaluated without the need for robot hardware.


This repository is about the development of Astrobee in ISS Kibo module . We are developing for the 2nd KIBO PROGRAMMING CHALLAGNE . For this development JAXA is using JAVA programming language .
